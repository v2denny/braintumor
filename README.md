# Brain Tumor Segmentation
The main focus of this project is to explore the implementation of [`ClearML`](https://clear.ml) (ML versioning tool) into segmentation projects.

Simple brain tumor segmentation using [`YOLOv11`](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and [`UNet` (PyTorch)](https://pytorch.org) architectures.

Used [Brain Tumor](https://universe.roboflow.com/instant-8qfjt/brain-tumor-yzzav-gfuc5) dataset from `Roboflow`.
